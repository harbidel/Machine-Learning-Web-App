# Machine-Learning-Web-App
## Machine Learning Web App with Streamlit, Sci-kit learn and Matplotlib
In this Project I build an interactive machine learning app with Streamlit and Scikit-learn to explore different datasets and classifier. 
This project  demonstrate how easy interactive web applications can be build with Streamlit. 
Streamlit lets you create beautiful apps for your machine learning projects with simple Python scripts.
